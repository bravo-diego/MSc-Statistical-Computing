Big Data Course MSc Statistical Computing CIMAT Monterrey 

***

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to big data concepts and their practical applications. Students gain hands-on experience with PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, to efficiently handle, process, and analyze large-scale datasets.

The course also explores Machine Learning algorithms through PySpark's MLlib library, enabling the implementation of both supervised and unsupervised learning models at scale. Additionally, students review the fundamentals of nonlinear encoding and Deep Learning for tasks such as image classification, combining big data processing with advanced ML and DL approaches to solve complex problems.
