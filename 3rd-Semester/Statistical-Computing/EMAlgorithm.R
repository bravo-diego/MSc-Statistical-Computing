# Consider the following experiment: a coin (A or B) is randomly chosen, and then a coin toss is performed with that coin, with the possible outcomes being Heads (Sol) and Tails (√Åguila). The result of this experiment is:

  # 1) A Heads, 2) B Tails, 3) A Tails, 4) B Heads, 5) B Tails, 6) NA, Tails

# If we parametrize as follows:
  
  # theta: Probability that the coin is A.
  # theta_A: Probability that the result is Heads given that the coin is A.
  # theta_B: Probability that the result is Heads given that the coin is B.

# Use the EM algorithm techniques to estimate the parameters theta, theta_A, and theta_B, considering the presence of missing data.

# In this case, the selected coin in 6) is a latent variable, as it cannot be directly observed or measured, but it influences the observable outcomes of the experiment.
