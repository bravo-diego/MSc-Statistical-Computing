Statistical Computing Course MSc Statistical Computing CIMAT Monterrey 

***

This course is structured to provide students with the fundamental concepts of statistical computing and their practical applications in data analysis. Through hands-on experience with the R programming language, students learn to implement essential techniques, including generalized linear models (GLM), resampling methods such as bootstrap and cross-validation (CV), and imputation methods for handling missing data.

The course also covers advanced topics, including model selection and regularization through subset selection and shrinkage methods, with a focus on key techniques such as stepwise selection, Lasso, and Ridge regression. Additionally, students are introduced to the fundamentals of time series analysis, enhancing their analytical skillset. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, the course equips students with essential tools for statistical modeling and comprehensive data analysis.
