### About

Hydrodynamic cavitation is an emerging technology for non-chemical water disinfection. While experimental studies have demonstrated its effectiveness, there is a significant gap in theoretical modeling to explain the underlying physical and biological mechanisms. This project aimed to fill that gap by developing a **Bayesian Network** to model the causal relationships between key experimental variables and reduction in bacterial viability following cavitation treatment.

This project was developed as part of the *Consultancy Course* within the MSc in Statistical Computing at Mathematics Research Center (CIMAT). This course offers students the opportunity to collaborate with external partners to address real-world challenges. In this case, the project was conducted in collaboration with the [Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Division](https://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/dimei/) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

This project was conducted under a confidentiality agreement. While this summary shares an overview of the problem and objectives, detailed data and proprietary device specifications remain confidential.
